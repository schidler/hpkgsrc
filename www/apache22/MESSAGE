As of Apache 2.2.16, all Apache modules will be built as shared
modules instead of being statically compiled into Apache.

If upgrading from a previous version of Apache, you will need to
add "LoadModule" directives to the your Apache configuration
otherwise you may experience problems.

See ${PREFIX}/share/examples/httpd/httpd.conf for a list of
"LoadModule" directives to be added to ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/httpd/httpd.conf
that should restore the previous behaviour.
