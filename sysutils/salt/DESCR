Salt is a powerful remote execution manager that can be used to
administer servers in a fast and efficient way.

Salt allows commands to be executed across large groups of servers. This
means systems can be easily managed, but data can also be easily
gathered. Quick introspection into running systems becomes a reality.

Remote execution is usually used to set up a certain state on a remote
system. Salt addresses this problem as well, the salt state system uses
salt state files to define the state a server needs to be in.

Between the remote execution system, and state management Salt addresses
the backbone of cloud and data center management.
