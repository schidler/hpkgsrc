The Perl 5 module local::lib allows for the bootstrapping and usage
of a directory containing Perl modules outside of Perl's @INC. This
makes it easier to ship an application with an app-specific copy
of a Perl module, or collection of modules. Useful in cases like
when an upstream maintainer hasn't applied a patch to a module of
theirs that you need for your application.
