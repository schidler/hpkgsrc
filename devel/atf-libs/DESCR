The atf-libs package provides the development libraries of the Automated
Testing Framework (ATF).  These libraries allow developers to write test
programs that can later be run by the ATF tools (in the atf package) or,
preferably, by Kyua (in the kyua-cli package).

The included libraries are: libatf-c, libatf-c++ and libatf-sh.
