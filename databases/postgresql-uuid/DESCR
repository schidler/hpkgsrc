The ``uuid'' PostgreSQL package implements creation of Universally
Unique Identifiers (UUIDs), also referred to as Globally Unique
Identifiers (GUIDs).  Although PostgreSQL supports storing UUIDs as a
native datatype, it does not provide any mechanism for creating them.
This package wraps openssl-supplied md5 and sha1 functions to create
UUIDs within PostgreSQL.
