window(1) implements a windowing environment on ASCII terminals.
It is similar to tmux and GNU screen.

The program provided by this package is based on the original code of
window(1) shipped by NetBSD 5.x.  NetBSD is replacing window(1) with
tmux, and when that happens this package will be the canonical source
for window(1).
