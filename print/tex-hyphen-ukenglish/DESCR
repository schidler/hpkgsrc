These patterns were derived from a word-division list generously
provided by the Oxford University Press (for the purpose of generating
these patterns, only).  'British English' hyphenation differs from the
default patterns provided with TeX, in that they are etymologically
based; American patterns tend to be more pragmatically derived.
