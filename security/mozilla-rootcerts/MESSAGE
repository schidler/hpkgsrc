Execute these commands to extract and rehash all CA root certificates
distributed by the Mozilla Project, so that they can be used by third
party applications using OpenSSL:

	# cd /etc/openssl/certs # Default SSLCERTS path for NetBSD
	# mozilla-rootcerts extract
	# mozilla-rootcerts rehash

To create a single file certificate bundle in PEM format which can
be used by applications using GnuTLS, do the following:

	# mkdir -p /etc/ssl/certs
	# cd /etc/ssl/certs
	# cat ../../openssl/certs/*.pem >ca-certificates.crt

To mark these certificates as trusted for users of gnupg2, do
the following (assuming default PKG_SYSCONFBASE and a Bourne shell):

	# mkdir /usr/pkg/etc/gnupg
	# cd /usr/pkg/etc/gnupg
	# for c in /etc/openssl/certs/*.pem; do
	> openssl x509 -in $c -noout -fingerprint|sed 's|^.*=\(.*\)|\1 S|'
	> done > trustlist.txt
