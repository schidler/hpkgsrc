LibTomCrypt is a fairly comprehensive, modular and portable
cryptographic toolkit that provides developers with a vast array of
well known published block ciphers, one-way hash functions, chaining
modes, pseudo-random number generators, public key cryptography and a
plethora of other routines.  LibTomCrypt has been designed from the
ground up to be very simple to use.  It has a modular and standard API
that allows new ciphers, hashes and PRNGs to be added or removed
without change to the overall end application.  It features easy to
use functions and a complete user manual which has many source snippet
examples.
