 $NetBSD: TODO,v 1.1 2008/04/24 07:40:24 bjs Exp $

 Here is a [possibly non-exhaustive] list of issues to resolve prior 
 to the next quarterly freeze:

 - Add/verify platform-specific values to use when restoring the FPU
   control word.

 - The Mesa master branch uses autoconf.  Unfortunately, last I checked, 
   they do not use it to enable the heap allocator, nor use of floating-point 
   functions in libm, etc.  Perhaps we should take a field trip to the 
   autoconf archive and write some of the m4 code required to implement 
   these tests.  After all, pkgsrc is uncommon in that we do not 
   assume the entire world conforms to the behavior of (recent?) Linux 
   "distros".

 - Check to see if HZ is actually used anywhere.  Cursory grepping
   of the code found nothing.

 - Once we settle on which build-time configuration variables we will
   use, document them and/or add them to mk/defaults/mk.conf.

 - The xcb (X C Bindings, not X Cut Buffer, heh) support is currently 
   disabled.

 - The pkg-config files are not generated with any dependency information.
   I'm not sure that anything in pkgsrc currently uses these, though.

 - I have not packaged the new MesaDemos yet due to lack of time.
