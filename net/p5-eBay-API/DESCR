This document describes the installation, configuration, and usage
of eBay::API module.

The eBay::API library is based on the eBay API XML schema and it
does not use SOAP to submit calls. Other than differences in the
SOAP envelope and the way SOAP reports errors, the calls and data
types defined in eBay API XML schema and eBay API wsdl are almost
exactly the same.

You can retrieve the latest version of eBay API XML schema from:

   http://developer.ebay.com/webservices/latest/eBaySvc.xsd

During installation that document is used to generate the library's
call and data type classes.
