Skype is a free program that uses P2P technology to bring affordable
and high-quality voice communications to people all over the world.

This package is specifically for Skype 2.1.x, as from 2.2.x Skype started
to use the inotify(7) system call which is not available on some other
systems' Linux emulations.
