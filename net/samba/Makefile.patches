# This Makefile fragment describes the recommended patches for the

# particular release of Samba are also integrated into the next release
# of Samba, so upon updating to the latest release of Samba, the
# PATCHFILES variable should be empty.
#
# The PATCHFILES are listed in chronological order according to the time
# they are added to ${PATCH_SITES}.
