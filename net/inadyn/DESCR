INADYN is a dynamic DNS client. That is, it maintains the IP address of a
host name. It periodically checks whether the IP address stored by the DNS
server is the real current address of the machine that is running INADYN.

   Features:

     * supports the following dynamic DNS services:
     * dyndns.org (in all three flavors: dynamic, static, custom)
     * freedns.afraid.org
     * zoneedit.com
     * no-ip.com
     * maintains up multiple aliases of the same IP address
     * runs as a service (Windows 2000/XP, Linux)
     * or runs as a console application
     * updates the correct IP address even behind a NAT router.
     * supports access via http proxy
     * does not perform unnecessary updates.
     * has 'install and forget it feature'. That is, after install one can
       completely forget about it. No maintenance required. (as long as no
       bugs are found;-)
