Please read the general README file as well.

bootstrap-pkgsrc has been tested on Haiku R1 alpha1 and alpha2 (i386) with
both gcc2 and gcc4.

Known problems:
 * Only tested with --unprivileged.
 * With gcc2, need to patch for system header files

   (It was fixed in r38711, so future release will not require the patch)
