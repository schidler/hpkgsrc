.Sh NAME
.Nm mksandbox
.Nd set up a sandbox
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Fl pkgsrc Ns = Ns Ar dir
.Op Fl Fl src Ns = Ns Ar srcdir
.Op Fl Fl verbose
.Op Fl Fl without-x
.Op Fl Fl xsrc Ns = Ns Ar xsrcdir
.Ar sandbox-dir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a small shell script to set up a sandbox (usually for a pkgsrc bulk
build), using null mounts.
The sandbox is set up for the target directory
.Ar sandbox-dir .
.Pp
The supported options are:
.Bl -tag -width "Xpkgsrc=dirXXX"
.It Fl Fl pkgsrc Ns = Ns Ar dir
Look for the pkgsrc files in
.Ar dir
instead of the default
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc .
.It Fl Fl src Ns = Ns Ar srcdir
Look for the
.Nx
src files in
.Ar dir
instead of the default
.Pa /usr/src
(only needed for some packages that compile kernel modules).
.It Fl Fl verbose
More verbose output.
.It Fl Fl without-x
Do not include X files in the sandbox.
.It Fl Fl xsrc Ns = Ns Ar xsrcdir
Look for the
.Nx
xsrc files in
.Ar dir
instead of the default
.Pa /usr/src
(only needed for some packages).
.El
.Sh USAGE
After
.Nm
has finished successfully,
.Ar sandbox-dir
will contain a file
.Pa sandbox
which can be used to set up and tear down the sandbox, as well as
execute commands inside.
The
.Pa sandbox
script supports the following commands:
.Bl -tag -width XanythingXelseXXX
.It Ic mount
Set up the sandbox.
.It Ic umount
Tear down the sandbox.
.It (no argument)
Start
.Xr ksh 1
inside the sandbox.
Can only be called after
.Ic mount .
.It anything-else
Try running
.Pa anything-else
inside the sandbox.
Fails if the argument is not an executable.
Can only be called after
.Ic mount .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The most common usage is running mksandbox once, e.g.
.Dl mksandbox /home/user/sandboxdir
and then reusing this sandbox.
Once the sandbox exists, the most common usage is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /home/user/sandboxdir
\&./sandbox mount
\&./sandbox
(do something inside, like a bulk build or building one package by hand)
(CTRL-D or logout, to leave the shell inside the sandbox)
\&./sandbox umount
