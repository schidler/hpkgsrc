MESS is a source-available project which documents the hardware
for a wide variety of (mostly vintage) computers, video game
consoles, and calculators through software emulation, as MAME does
for arcade games. As a nice side effect to this documentation, MESS
allows software and games for these hardware platforms to be run
on modern PCs.
