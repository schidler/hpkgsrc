Hints and tips for OpenSCAD:

openscad-2011.12: Sometimes it doesn't seem to render all objects when
rendering with the fast OpenCSG. It is not yet clear if this is a problem with
OpenSCAD or with OpenCSG. The solution is to add the render() primitive to the
function. This will then use CGAL to create a primitive even when rendering
with OpenCSG. It also speeds up rendering significantly since it creates them
as primitives! So transform

	func(l) {
		....
	}
to
	func(l) render() {
		....
	}

if you encounter render problems or when rendering a primitive is very slow.
