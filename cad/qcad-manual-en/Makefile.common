# >=2.0.4.0 because no new manual release has been made yet to go with
# qcad-2.0.5.0.  Actually a set of English manual files can be found in
# the qcad-2.0.5.0 source package, but a file-by-file comparison shows them
# to be MORE out of date than 2.0.4.0, older versions that somehow mistakenly
# got included. A user is better off with the 2.0.4.0 manual.
